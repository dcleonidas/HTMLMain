      <h3> Jared's early life is best passed over, and parts of it he cannot legally discuss because of non-discolsure clauses in settlements, but he managed to rise about it thanks a series of largely well-meaning foster parents and went on to recieve a B.A. from Vassar College in Economics. During those happiest of years, he sand second alto with the Joyce Carol Notes A Cappella Confrontation and was both coxswain for Women's Heavyweight Crew. He was also the writer and assistant stage manager of the opera "American HerStory XX. Prior to his employment with Pied Piper he was a Hooli executive and right-hand mand to the head of company, Gavin Belson, but after gaining a particular interest in Richard Hendrix's algorithm, quit his job at Hooli to work for Pied Piper. Jared currently is head of business development at Pied Piper and lives in the server room.</h3>
